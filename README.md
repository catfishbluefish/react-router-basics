## Working React Router Tutorial for Treehouse
So there I was, coding along through projects on Treehouse, when all of a sudden
I couldn't learn anymore. This wasn't a lack of motivation, but rather a finicky
git repo from the Treehouse team that didn't allow me, or others, to complete their
[React Router Tutorial](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-router-basics).

This repo is a result of my frustrations of trying to reconfigure their Webpack so
I could complete the tutorial and failing to understand everything they were
trying to do.

Clone this repo, actually complete the tutorial, and go on to build some awesome
shit with React and React Router. Cheers!

## Getting Started
Note that you need git installed. If you're not familiar with git, you shouldn't
even be learning about frameworks yet. Now git!

```
$ git clone https://github.com/andesitedesign/react-router-basics.git
$ cd react-router-basics
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
